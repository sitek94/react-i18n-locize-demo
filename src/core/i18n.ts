/**
 * @fileoverview i18n initialization
 *
 * The translations can be found in the `public/locales` folder.
 *
 * ⚠️ If you're a Polish speaker, you may notice, that I'm not doing a really
 * good job with the translations and some texts are actually completely different
 * to the ones in English. I don't really care, because it's just a demo, but you
 * probably shouldn't do it in production
 *
 * 🚓 Keys Naming Convention
 *
 * - camelCase should be used for keys, so that they are distinguishable from plurals
 *   - e.g. "helloWorld", "column1", "column2"
 * - use full words: "description" instead of "desc"
